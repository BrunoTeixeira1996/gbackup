# TODO

- Create rsyncs and cronjobs
  - [x] Create postgresql (needs testing in proxmox)
  - [x] Create gokr_backup_perm (needs testing in proxmox)
  - [x] Create syncthing_backup (needs testing in proxmox)
  - [x] Create backup for gokrazy config files that are present in my laptop
	- my laptop has a running cronjob that sends the gokrazy folder
	- and then proxmox backups that to storagepool
  - [x] Create leak_backup (needs testing in proxmox)
	- Fix leak_backup cronjob architecture
  - [x] Create backup for grafana and prometheus conf files
	- proxmox will download conf files from prometheus and grafana lxc
	- then it will save in the external hard drive and then copy to storagepool
  - [x] Add rule in AlertManager for cronjobs
  - [x] Setup crontab in proxmox
  - [x] Create Make file for uploading this to proxmox
  - [x] Implement goroutines for a faster backup
	- Every block of backup can run in a goroutine since the data that is shared is from rsync and cmd
	- [x] There's a bug in the log since it prints randomly
  - [x] Setup Email alert when script finishes (this is easier than seting up AlertManager to send alert when event is not failing)
  - [x] Format output as html template so its better to read
  - [x] Add more stuff when sending Email
	- Timestamp
	- Log
	- Number of backups and number of well executed backups
  - [] Add temp control for the raspberry pi (node_hwmon_temp_celsius{instance="brun0-pi:9100"}) - create alert for temp high than 60
  - [x] Document (properly) what every rsync and cronjobs do
